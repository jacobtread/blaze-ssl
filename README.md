## ‚ùî What

This is a bare minimum implementation of the SSLv3 protocol it implements only the specific server logic
required by the gosredirector.ea.com server. This implementation forces the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA cipher
suite and that is the only one implemented.

## ‚ùî Why 

This SSL implementation is to provide the bare minimum SSL implementation required for the
initial redirect portion of the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer protocol when the client reaches 
out to gosredirector.ea.com. The client refuses to use any other protocols or cipher suites 
and in order to use SSLv3 and these cipher suites you either have to modify Registry keys
(In the case of Schannel) or compile a custom version of OpenSSL; Which isn't very practical
or intuitive for emulating these servers.
